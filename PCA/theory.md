Principal Component Analysis is not a ML algorithm but a technique to reduce dimensionality by using a new vector space. Need to perform Standardization or min-max scaling before proceeding with this technique.

Auto Encoders and decoders are similar to PCA for dimensionality reduction in DL.

PCA is a process of figuring out most important features or principal components that have the most impact on the target variable.

More variance implies more information.

Things to remember while applying PCA:
- Scale features before applying PCA
- Accuracy might drop

PCA is called dimensionality reduction technique as it can help us reduce dimensions leading to less training time required.
